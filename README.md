### Hi there ğŸ‘‹

<!--
**adamazizi10/adamazizi10** is a âœ¨ _special_ âœ¨ repository because its `README.md` (this file) appears on your GitHub profile.

I am adam.

I like all areas of software especially web development.

I usually work with reactjs for front-end and Node.js with Express.js for the back-end.

I enjoy working on my projects and always try to learn from my mistakes and improve.

I did an internship at Salumatics as a Software Engineer where I learned a lot about Full Stack Development.

Feel free to reach out to me.
