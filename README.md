### Hi there ðŸ‘‹

As a driven and dedicated Computer Software Engineering student at Toronto Metropolitan University, I have gained valuable experience in a range of programming languages, frameworks and technologies. I am passionate about utilizing my skills to solve complex problems and create innovative solutions. I have a strong foundation in object-oriented programming languages such as Java, Python, C++ and JavaScript. I am proficient in working with relational databases such as MySQL, PostgreSQL, Oracle Database and Microsoft SQL Server, as well as conducting JUnit and Selenium testing in both Java and Python.

During my internship at Salumatics, I had the opportunity to contribute to the development of a web application for the company. Working as part of a team, I gained practical experience in agile development methodologies, as well as collaborating with stakeholders to ensure the successful delivery of the project. In addition, I have worked on projects that require Full Stack Development skills such as React.js, Node.js and Express.js. I have also utilized Python for scripting, web scraping, web development, machine learning and data science, as well as Selenium testing.

As a highly adaptable individual, I thrive in dynamic environments and am always eager to learn new technologies and methodologies. Feel free to connect with me via email, Discord, or over a coffee chat.
