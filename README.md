### Hi there ðŸ‘‹

I am a Computer Software Engineering student at Toronto Metropolitan University with experience in various programming languages, frameworks, and technologies. My passion lies in solving complex problems and developing innovative solutions. I have a strong foundation in object-oriented programming languages, relational databases, and testing. During my internship at Salumatics, I gained experience in agile development methodologies, collaborated with stakeholders, and worked on Full Stack Development projects. I am highly adaptable and always eager to learn new technologies and methodologies. In my free time outside of work, I find joy in engaging in sports such as soccer and basketball. Additionally, my passion for soccer drives me to stay well-informed about the sport by following current news and matches. I'm very approachable and easy to talk to so feel free to reach out to me.
